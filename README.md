# README

This folder is a basic Vagrant VM for this project. 

If you're not familiar with Vagrant, first get Vagrant and VirtualBox installed. 
Then just copy the "Vagrantfile.dist" to just "Vagrantfile",
then go into that folder in a terminal and run `vagrant up`.
 
You can then see the app running by visiting http://localhost:8080/
